# Jakarta Faces TCK

We have two ways of running the Faces TCK: Docker or locally
These are separated into the two modules: `faces-tck-docker-runner` and `faces-tck-runner` respectively

The two extra POMs in this directory, `pom.xml-old-tck-run` and `pom.xml-tck` are used by these modules to replace the poms provided by the TCK
